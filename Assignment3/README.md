# Multi-layered Seq2Seq Model for transliteration
To train the seq2seq model, Follow the following steps:
* Open the Assignment3 ipynb file
* Run the Library import, Dataset Loading, Function defining sections.
* For the data loading, adjust the data paths in the data loading section.
* To train and get predictions on the best model, run the 'Best model on test data' section in the notebook.
* The predictions from this model can be used to plot the confusion matrix.
* To get prediction on the same model with attention, run the 'Best model with attention' section in the notebook.
* These predictions can be used to visualize the attention and its working with the help of attention heatmaps and visualizations from the corresponding sections.
